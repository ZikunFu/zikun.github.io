# Greetings!

My name is **Zikun Fu**, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Information Science at Ontario Tech University, specializing in **Machine Learning**, **Databases**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I am passionate about advancing technologies that bridge human understanding and structured systems.

When I'm not coding or researching, I enjoy immersing myself in **sci-fi and fantasy shows** and playing **video games**.

# Current Research

I focus on **Closed-Domain Named Entity Recognition (CD-NER)**.

> Closed-domain named entity recognition (CD-NER) involves extracting entities from a fixed set of values in a database. Unlike general-purpose NER, CD-NER leverages domain-specific properties to improve extraction. However, challenges such as large entity pools, domain-specific vocabulary, and varied phrasing complicate extraction efforts. My research addresses these challenges by developing new benchmarks and techniques.

## **Contributions**
- **Benchmark Development**: Converted text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., BIRD, Spider) into CD-NER benchmarks using structured annotations and fuzzy matching techniques.
- **Model Evaluation**: Fine-tuned state-of-the-art NER models (T5, Flair) and proposed baselines for CD-NER tasks.
- **Innovative Techniques**: Addressed challenges in tokenization, synonyms, and alignment using domain-specific strategies.

## **Talks and Publications**
- Presented **“Transforming Text-to-SQL Datasets into Closed-Domain NER Benchmarks”** at [Ontario Database Day 2024 (OnDBD)](https://ondbd.ca/talk_2024/talk_32.pdf), University of Waterloo.  
  - Shared methodologies and findings with database and NLP experts across Ontario.
  - Explored collaborative approaches to advancing database-driven NLP tasks.  
- Authored an article on [Approaches and Challenges in Annotating a Closed-Domain NER Dataset](https://kenpu.ca/articles/Approaches%20and%20Challenges%20in%20Annotating%20a%20Closed%20Domain%20NER%20Dataset.html).  
  - Discussed techniques for creating CD-NER benchmarks, alignment issues, and best practices in annotation.
