# Greetings!

My name is **Zikun Fu**, a graduate student in Information Science at Ontario Tech University.  
I have a strong background in AI, Machine Learning and data science.  

I am currently pursuing a Master of Information Science at Ontario Tech University, specializing in 
Machine Learning, Databases, and Natural Language Processing. 

I love exploring how AI can improve workflows—whether it’s automating repetitive tasks with Python & Bash 
or integrating advanced ML models to solve data-driven challenges.

When I'm not coding or researching, I'm a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy shows, as well as video games.

# Current Research

I focus on **Closed-Domain Named Entity Recognition (CD-NER)**, a specialized area of NLP that extracts entities from a fixed database schema. This contrasts with general-purpose NER by leveraging domain-specific contexts and handling vast, predefined vocabularies.

## Key Highlights

### Contributions
- **Dataset Creation**: Converted text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., BIRD) into CD-NER benchmarks using fuzzy string matching and structured annotations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Fine-tuned state-of-the-art NER models (T5 and Flair) on CD-NER benchmark.

### Challenges Addressed
- **Domain-Specific Vocabulary**: Tackled challenges with varied phrasing, synonyms, and tokenization.
- **Annotation Quality**: Improved alignment between database schemas and natural language through advanced fuzzy matching techniques.

My research aims to advance CD-NER by addressing its unique challenges and enabling better extraction from structured database schemas, paving the way for innovations in database-driven NLP tasks.
