# About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master of Information Science at Ontario Tech University, specializing in 
Machine Learning, Databases, and Natural Language Processing. 

I love exploring how AI can improve workflows—whether it’s automating repetitive tasks with Python & Bash 
or integrating advanced ML models to solve data-driven challenges.

When I'm not coding or researching, I'm a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy shows. I find special effects 
and VFX incredibly exciting—particularly the ones that help bring futuristic worlds to life.
