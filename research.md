*(You can paste or summarize your LaTeX content here, or attach a PDF for download.)*

## Key Highlights:
- **Text-to-SQL** Datasets (BIRD, Spider)
- **NER Benchmark** Conversion
- **Evaluation** with T5 and Flair
- **Future Work**: Improving fuzzy string matching, handling synonyms, advanced SOTA models (GLiNER, GoLLIE, UniNER)
